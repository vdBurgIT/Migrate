# Sketch a Slide

Use Whiteboard to sketch a slide layout, capture the result, and translate it into a real slide component.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Open Whiteboard

```powershell
Start-Process "ms-whiteboard-cmd:"
```

Tell the user:

> **Whiteboard is open. Sketch your slide layout. When you're done, use "Fit to screen" (Ctrl+Shift+F) so the entire sketch is visible, then tell me you're ready.**

**STOP here.** Do NOT proceed until the user explicitly says the sketch is ready.

### Step 2 — Capture the sketch

When the user says the sketch is ready:

```powershell
Add-Type @"
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using System.Drawing;
public class WinCapture {
    [DllImport("user32.dll")] public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr h);
    [DllImport("user32.dll")] public static extern bool GetWindowRect(IntPtr h, out RECT r);
    [DllImport("user32.dll")] public static extern bool SetProcessDPIAware();
    [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)] public struct RECT { public int L, T, R, B; }
}
"@
[WinCapture]::SetProcessDPIAware() | Out-Null
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Drawing
$h = (Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.MainWindowTitle -like '*Whiteboard*' } | Select-Object -First 1).MainWindowHandle
if (!$h -or $h -eq [IntPtr]::Zero) { Write-Error "Whiteboard window not found"; return }
[WinCapture]::SetForegroundWindow($h) | Out-Null
Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500
$r = New-Object WinCapture+RECT
[WinCapture]::GetWindowRect($h, [ref]$r) | Out-Null
$w = $r.R - $r.L; $ht = $r.B - $r.T
$bmp = New-Object Drawing.Bitmap $w, $ht
$g = [Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($bmp)
$g.CopyFromScreen($r.L, $r.T, 0, 0, (New-Object Drawing.Size $w, $ht))
$dir = ".github\eyes"
if (!(Test-Path $dir)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dir -Force | Out-Null }
$file = Join-Path $dir "sketch-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH-mm-ss').png"
$bmp.Save($file)
$g.Dispose(); $bmp.Dispose()
Write-Host "Sketch saved: $file"
```

### Step 3 — Analyze the sketch

Reference the saved screenshot image. Study it carefully and identify:

- **Layout structure** — columns/rows, content zones, header/footer areas
- **Text elements** — headings, labels, bullet points, callouts
- **Visual elements** — boxes, icons, images, dividers, backgrounds
- **Data patterns** — tables, grids, lists, charts, metrics

Describe what you see back to the user and confirm your interpretation.

### Step 4 — Build the slide with the active descriptor

Before creating code:

1. Read `deck.config.js`
2. Read `theme` and `designSystem`
3. Resolve the active theme descriptor using the same rules as `deck-add-slide`
4. Use **deck-add-slide** plus that descriptor to build the real slide

While translating the sketch:

1. Map sketch regions to CSS Grid or Flexbox layout
2. Translate hand-drawn text into real content with proper typography
3. Replace rough shapes with styled containers using CSS Modules
4. Follow the active descriptor for JSX skeleton, CSS skeleton, decoration, tokens, and allowed components
5. Register the slide in `deck.config.js`

### Step 5 — Visual verification

After creating the slide, use **deck-inspect** to capture a screenshot of the rendered result.

Compare the rendered slide against the original sketch. If the user is present, show both and ask if adjustments are needed.

## Notes

- Whiteboard sketches are rough — interpret intent, not exact pixels
- If text is hard to read, ask the user to clarify
- Screenshots are saved under `.github/eyes/` (gitignored) with a `sketch-` prefix
